# Neural-Art

Flask app for style transfer using neural network

### Prerequisites

* Pytorch
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Flask

### Installing

Install the prerequisties

To run it locally, first clone the directory - 
`git clone https://github.com/p-rit/Neural-Art.git`

Then run `python script.py` in cmd

Go to localhost:5000 in your web browser

Select the Style image and then upload the content image (the image on which you want to apply style) then click the 'upload' button. You have to wait few minutes to see the results as it's not real time style transfer.
